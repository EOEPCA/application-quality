# Application Quality

This repository contains the code and the documentation of the **Application Quality** Building Block.

The purpose of this BB is to promote high-quality and reproducible scientific practices of the generated workflows.

Open reproducible science implies that the BB should facilitate transparent and replicable workflow processes. Best development practices should be followed to ensure that each workflow step is reliable, maintainable, and adheres to industry standards.

Integrated within the EOEPCA framework, the *Application Quality* BB provides functionalities accessible through web interfaces, allowing users to interact with the services over the internet. The BB contributes in making data, methods, and results transparent and accessible to the user community.

The workflows development process should adhere to recognized best practices, such as version control, documentation, and code review, to ensure high-quality and maintainable code.
