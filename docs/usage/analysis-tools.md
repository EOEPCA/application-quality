# Analysis Tools

## Overview

This chapter introduces the analysis tools integrated, or candidate for integration, into the *Application Quality* BB.

Each of these tools allows analysing and validating application code or execution artefacts from the quality, security, or performance perspective.

The analysis tools are pre-loaded in the database at deployment time (from an embedded fixture document). They may be edited directly in the database using the backend (Django) administration interface however this require a proper understanding of how pipelines and tools are defined.

The available tools are listed with their details in the *Application Quality* Web interface. The same interface allows authenticated users to integrate the tools in custom pipelines. You will find the instructions in the Application Quality [User Manual](https://eoepca.readthedocs.io/projects/application-quality/en/latest/usage/user-manual/).

### How Analysis Tools Are Implemented and Executed

The tools in the *Application Quality* BB are implemented using the [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/index.html) (CWL), and executed by [Calrissian](https://github.com/Duke-GCB/calrissian) and the reference implementation [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool). The BB makes use of the [pycalrissian](https://github.com/Terradue/pycalrissian) Python library to setup and execute the analysis pipelines in the local Kubernetes cluster (possibly in a virtual cluster if this is option is activated).

Each tool is defined as a CWL `CommandLineTool` (CLT). These tools are typically invoked within a CWL `Workflow`, which orchestrates multiple `CommandLineTool` components. Some additional tools in these workflows handle auxiliary tasks such as filtering files from a cloned git repository or saving the analysis results to the database.

### How Tools are Parameterised

Most of the integrated tools support many command line parameters that allow controlling their behaviour.

To allow using these parameters in analysis pipelines (through the UI or the API), the CLT in which the tool is integrated must define the corresponding inputs and use these inputs in the embedded scripts.

The sections below describe the parameters that have been implemented in the CLTs and can thus be used to parameterise the pipeline executions.

More parameters may be exposed as necessary by extending the definition of the CLTs in the database.

## Available tools

The following table organises the analysis tools per application type and per check type.

As can be seen, a number of tools are readily available. Feedback and requirements will be necessary to determine which tools will be integrated next.

## Tools description

### Development Best Practices

#### Pylint

> Pylint is a static code analyser for Python 2 or 3. Pylint analyses your code without actually running it.  
It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
